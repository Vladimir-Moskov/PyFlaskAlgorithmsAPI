# Context
The idea of the exercise is not to write the perfect solution, but rather to get a better
feeling of your problem solving skills, your understanding of the dataset you are working
with, your coding style and the tools you decide to use.
This will make the following interviews much easier for you since you have already
shown your technical skills in a realistic problem.

# Description
Please implement a web service which calculates and displays results for the following
algorithms:
- Calculating a Fibonacci number F(n) with the value of n provided by the user.
- The Ackermann function A(m,n) with values of m and n provided by the user.
- The factorial of a non-negative integer n provided by the user.

 * The results per function should be calculated separately and userâ€™s input should be
validated.

* You should also implement some monitoring of your choice where you can show the
retrieval and display of the time it takes to calculate the different functions.

# Deliverables
* You will need to send over your code in the email thread you got the assignment, along
with instructions on installing and running your code, an explanation of your choices.

 * The minimum expected is a readme file, but you can do it as nice as you want, it will
definitely give you points.

# Conditions
 * You are allowed to use python and any framework or library of your choice. You will be
judged for the quality of your code and not the language or framework you decided to
use.

 * You are not allowed to use any code you might find online, neither to publish your
solution or this document without our explicit consent. For any questions that might
arise, please ask within the email thread.
